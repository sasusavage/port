# Joshua Doe Portfolio

A high-impact, Apple-inspired personal portfolio that blends immersive motion, refined typography, and glassmorphism accents. Built with pure HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## ✨ Highlights

- Signature hero with layered parallax cards and gradient light orbs
- Scroll-triggered reveals that respect reduced-motion preferences
- Sticky, glassmorphic navigation with a minimal mobile menu
- Modular sections for About, Capabilities, Selected Work, and Contact
- Clean, responsive layout optimized for large displays down to mobile

## 🚀 Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve it locally for reliable font loading and smoother reloads:

```powershell
# from the project root
python -m http.server 8000
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## 🛠 Customize

- Update hero copy, timeline entries, and project highlights in `index.html`
- Adjust the visual theme (colors, spacing, radii) by editing CSS variables in `assets/css/styles.css`
- Extend or tweak motion behavior in `assets/js/main.js`; motion automatically pauses for users who prefer reduced motion
